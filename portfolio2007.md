_ **Achievements:** _

- Smart Card Hardware API development expertise (GemPlus 332, HID 6055B)
- Accomplished major innovation of our product involving the research &amp; development of a component to support smart card access control on personal office rooms&#39; cylinders. This feature was the core product selling point for that release whereby I was nominated by project management to head up this user story.
- Managed the suite of Digital Video Recording (DVR API) module of SiPass developing in C++ / COM interfacing with 3rd party recording hardware innovations. The video surveillance division was responsible for image capturing sequencing based on trigger-able alarm events. I implemented enhancements in C++ COM to in response to 3rd party vendor requests. (C++, ATL, STL, COM)

- Appraised for succinct analysis skills after delivering solutions to non-deterministic critical live anomalies eliminating the impact to the system and reducing client complaints.
- Resolved 50+ show-stopping site problems mitigated by effective solutions with zero-risk. Recognised for my diligence to follow through pursuing tracking the bad patterns throughout the code base and resolving accordingly. C++, C# .NET, COM, .NET Remoting, SQL Server, Wise, Memory Leaks
- Driven with a sense of ownership &amp; proven ability to deliver zero-risk solutions the project manager consequently delegated more show-stopping site issues, more enhancements and more development areas to take charge of. Assigned lead for one to three engineers in recognition of my leadership qualities and knowledge in development areas and held responsibility of the outcome of the leading tasks.
- Resolved a complicated non-deterministic OLE Server Busy issue which was left unsolved for many years. Discovered the issue to be performance related in the C++ RPC connectivity to the server. Resolved &amp; delivered with assistance from engineers that had experience with these legacy modules. (C++, MFC)
- Assigned responsibility for quality assurance of requirements, design &amp; API manuals from other engineers in recognition to my attention to quality.
- Strategized an automation tool to cut the huge costs €1.5 million in localizing the software into 12+ languages per release. Recognised as the SME and consequently supervised 2-3 engineers to develop the automated solution using C#, scripting, C++ API interfacing and was highly appraised for cutting the cost of effort by 40+%. (C# .NET, Scripting, C++ RC-WinTrans API)

_ **Projects** __:_

_SiPass Enterprise_

- Designed from inception the alarm module for the new SiPass Enterprise system. The alarms alerting module provides a system wide ability to trigger, acknowledge, report on alarms. Implemented integration bridge with SiPass for cross-communication. (C# .NET, WinForms .NET, Composite UI Application Block, NUnit .NET, COM+ Message Queue, XML)
- Designed the licence generation mechanism with a custom hashing algorithm for SiPass Enterprise (C++.NET, NUnit .NET, C++ COM Unit Test, ASP.NET Unit Test). Managed the licencing module thereon.

_Sipass Hardware Mechanics_

- Designed &amp; Implemented a module that supports pre-released smart card readers (two developments; GemPlus, HID, OmniKey) using a C++ API interface. (C++, OO Design, API interfacing). Managed the smart card division of SiPass from thereon.
- Designed &amp; implemented a module that introduced turnstile door types to the system. Required conceptualisation of the turnstile operation. (C++, MFC, COM, SQL Server, XML)
- Led the suite of Digital Video Recording division of SiPass using C++ / COM interfacing to 3rd parties for them to develop device drivers. This included developing enhancements using C++ COM to maintain the video stream between the hardware in SiPass. (C++, ATL, STL, COM)
- Designed &amp; developed an innovative key marketable component a smart-card digital locking cylinder (HID&#39;s new R&amp;D invention) effectively creating a wireless unlocking effect for door users. This invention was designed with one fellow engineer and the framework that we designed was commended template for future client-server developments. (C#, .NET, Design Patterns, .NET Remoting, SQL Server)

_SiPass Integrated_

- Designed &amp; implemented enhancement where visitors are allowed access to the building on particular dates (C++, MFC)
- Designed &amp; implemented enhancement where users can scroll through a large database of cardholders with high performance &amp; concurrency considerations. (C++, MFC, SQL Server UDFs)
- Designed &amp; implemented mechanism for system-wide fetching of database credential information. (C++, COM, C++ .NET, C# .NET, C++ Cryptology, Wise for Windows Installer). The challenge overcame was designing it with extensibility in mind as it was used for all future projects data access.
- Designed &amp; implemented mechanism for system-wide fetching of system sensitive database credential information. (C++, COM, C++ .NET, C# .NET, C++ Cryptology, Wise for Windows Installer)
- Integrated an external legacy access control system into SiPass by designing a migration tool and developing integration features into SiPass. (C++, COM, MFC, ODBC)

- Resolved issue with where user sessions were not identified properly and caused reporting of logged in users incorrectly, C++, COM
- Designed 20+ system bite sized enhancements requested by product line (C# .NET, COM+ MFC, .NET Message Queue, Crystal Reports, C++)
- Designed &amp; implemented VC++7 module to detect which SQLServer versions are available on the domain &amp; implementing into Wise for Windows Installer. (VC++7, Wise for Windows Installer)
- Detected &amp; resolved C++ quality of code criteria to pass Windows Vista Certification
- Implemented Wise for Windows Installer packaging for packaging new system components.
