Smart card & DVR windows driver APIs, hardware/firmware interfacing via RPC

_ **Environments:** _ Windows XP/Vista

_ **Tools:** _ CVS, PR Tracker, Wise for Windows Installer, Windows Vista Certification

_ **Methodology:** _ Siemens Evolution Process (bespoke software process for coordinated delivery and iteration with software, firmware, hardware, and on-site deployment technicians)

_ **Description:** _ SiPass has been installed at 1300 sites in 55 countries world-wide, securing notable locations Huawei HQ (2000 doors), Beijing Television Centre (784 doors) and Wohnpark Alt Erlaa in Austria (744 doors).

_ **Achievements:** _

- *Smart Card Hardware API Development:* Gained development expertise in smart card hardware APIs (GemPlus 332, HID 6055B).
- *Innovative Feature Development:* Developed a component supporting smart card access control for personal office rooms' cylinders, a major product selling point. Contributed to 15% uptick in sales.
- *DVR API Module Lead:* Managed the Digital Video Recording (DVR) API module, responsible for image capturing sequencing based on alarm events. Developed C++ COM solutions for third party recording hardware innovations working directly with third party DVR vendors to source requirements. (C++, ATL, STL, COM)
- *Live Anomaly Solutions:* Delivered solutions to non-deterministic critical live anomalies, reducing end-user client complaints.  Glowing feedback from client appraising analysis skills and won team award for 'anomaly hunter' 
- Recognized for my diligence in tracking and resolving bad patterns throughout the codebase. C++, C# .NET, COM, .NET Remoting, SQL Server, Wise, Memory Leaks
- Driven by a strong sense of ownership and a proven ability to deliver zero-risk solutions, I earned the trust of the project manager, who consequently delegated more critical site issues, enhancements, and development areas to me. Recognized for my leadership qualities and development expertise, I was assigned as the lead developer, managing a team of one to three engineers and taking full responsibility for the outcome of our key tasks.
- Resolved a complex, non-deterministic OLE Server Busy issue that had remained unsolved for many years. Through rigorous root cause analysis, I identified the issue as a performance related in the C++ RPC connectivity to the server. With the help of engineers experienced in these legacy modules (C++, MFC), we successfully resolved and delivered the solution.
- I was also assigned the responsibility for quality assurance of requirements, design, and API manuals from other engineers, in recognition of my attention to quality.
- *Cost-Reduction Automation Tool:* Developed a tool that cut language localization costs by over 40% reducing expenses by €1.5 million. With the growing number of languages (12+) per release moving away from manual steps, I was self-motivated to engineer process optimization.  Promoted to localization expert and led a team of two to three engineers to push this engineering effort. (C# .NET, Scripting, C++ RC-WinTrans API)

_ **Projects** __:_

_SiPass Enterprise_

- Designed and implemented the alarm module for system-wide alarm triggering, acknowledging, and reporting.  Implemented integration bridge with SiPass (C++) and Enterprise (C#) for cross-communication interop. (C# .NET, WinForms .NET, Composite UI Application Block, NUnit .NET, COM+ Message Queue, XML)
- Created a custom hashing algorithm for license generation (C++.NET, NUnit .NET, C++ COM Unit Test, ASP.NET Unit Test).  

_Sipass Hardware Mechanics_

- Designed & Implemented a module that supports pre-released smart card readers (two developments; GemPlus, HID, OmniKey) using a C++ API interface. (C++, OO Design, API interfacing). Managed the smart card division of SiPass from thereon.
- Designed & implemented a module that introduced turnstile door types to the system. Required conceptualisation of the turnstile operation. (C++, MFC, COM, SQL Server, XML)
- Led the Digital Video Recording division, developing C++ COM interfaces for third party device drivers. Developed enhancement C++ COM to maintain the video stream between the hardware in SiPass. (C++, ATL, STL, COM)

This was a success and the pattern we invented were used henceforth for future client-server developments. (C#, .NET, Design Patterns, .NET Remoting, SQL Server)

_SiPass Integrated_

- Designed & implemented enhancement where visitors are allowed access to the building on particular dates (C++, MFC)
- Designed & implemented enhancement where users can scroll through a large database of cardholders with high performance & concurrency considerations. (C++, MFC, SQL Server UDFs)
- Designed & implemented mechanism for system-wide fetching of database credential information. (C++, COM, C++ .NET, C# .NET, C++ Cryptology, Wise for Windows Installer). The challenge overcame was designing it with extensibility in mind as it was used for all future projects data access.
- Designed & implemented mechanism for system-wide fetching of system sensitive database credential information. (C++, COM, C++ .NET, C# .NET, C++ Cryptology, Wise for Windows Installer)
- Integrated an external legacy access control system into SiPass by designing a migration tool and developing integration features into SiPass. (C++, COM, MFC, ODBC)
- Resolved issue with where user sessions were not identified properly and caused reporting of logged in users incorrectly, C++, COM
- Designed 20+ system bite sized enhancements requested by product line (C# .NET, COM+ MFC, .NET Message Queue, Crystal Reports, C++)
- Designed & implemented VC++7 module to detect which SQLServer versions are available on the domain & implementing into Wise for Windows Installer. (VC++7, Wise for Windows Installer)
- Detected & resolved C++ quality of code criteria to pass official Windows Vista Certification
- Implemented Wise for Windows Installer packaging for packaging new system components.
