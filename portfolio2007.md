_ **Methodology:** _ Siemens Evolution Process (bespoke software process for coordinated delivery and iteration with software, firmware, hardware, and on-site deployment technicians)

_ **Description:** _ SiPass has been installed at 1300 sites in 55 countries world-wide, securing notable locations Huawei HQ (2000 doors), Beijing Television Centre (784 doors) and Wohnpark Alt Erlaa in Austria (744 doors).

_ **Achievements:** _

- Smart Card Hardware API Development: Gained development expertise in smart card hardware APIs (GemPlus 332, HID 6055B).
- Innovative Feature Development: Developed a component supporting smart card access control for personal office rooms' cylinders, a major product selling point. Contributed to 15% uptick in sales.
- DVR API Module Lead: Managed the Digital Video Recording (DVR) API module, responsible for image capturing sequencing based on alarm events. Developed C++ COM solutions for third party recording hardware innovations working directly with third party DVR vendors to source requirements. (C++, ATL, STL, COM)
- Live Anomaly Solutions: Delivered solutions to non-deterministic critical live anomalies, reducing end-user client complaints.  Glowing feedback from client appraising analysis skills and won team award for 'anomaly hunter' 
- Recognised for my diligence to follow through pursuing tracking the bad patterns throughout the code base and resolving accordingly. C++, C# .NET, COM, .NET Remoting, SQL Server, Wise, Memory Leaks
- Driven with a sense of ownership & proven ability to deliver zero-risk solutions the project manager consequently delegated more show-stopping site issues, more enhancements and more development areas to take charge of. Assigned lead dev with one to three engineers in recognition of my leadership qualities and knowledge in development areas and was assigned responsibility of the outcome of the leading tasks.
- Resolved a complex, non-deterministic OLE Server Busy issue which was left unsolved for many years. Through rigorous root cause analysis, identified the issue to be performance related in the C++ RPC connectivity to the server. Resolved & delivered with assistance from engineers that had experience with these legacy modules. (C++, MFC)
- Assigned responsibility for quality assurance of requirements, design & API manuals from other engineers in recognition to my attention to quality.
- Cost-Reduction Automation Tool: Developed a tool that cut language localization costs by over 40% reducing expenses by €1.5 million. With the growing number of languages (12+) per release moving away from manual steps, I was self-motivated to engineer process optimization.  Promoted to localization expert and led a team of two to three engineers to push this engineering effort. (C# .NET, Scripting, C++ RC-WinTrans API)

_ **Projects** __:_

_SiPass Enterprise_

- Designed and implemented the alarm module for system-wide alarm triggering, acknowledging, and reporting.  Implemented integration bridge with SiPass (C++) and Enterprise (C#) for cross-communication interop. (C# .NET, WinForms .NET, Composite UI Application Block, NUnit .NET, COM+ Message Queue, XML)
- Created a custom hashing algorithm for license generation (C++.NET, NUnit .NET, C++ COM Unit Test, ASP.NET Unit Test).  

_Sipass Hardware Mechanics_

- Designed & Implemented a module that supports pre-released smart card readers (two developments; GemPlus, HID, OmniKey) using a C++ API interface. (C++, OO Design, API interfacing). Managed the smart card division of SiPass from thereon.
- Designed & implemented a module that introduced turnstile door types to the system. Required conceptualisation of the turnstile operation. (C++, MFC, COM, SQL Server, XML)
- Led the Digital Video Recording division, developing C++ COM interfaces for third party device drivers. Developed enhancement C++ COM to maintain the video stream between the hardware in SiPass. (C++, ATL, STL, COM)

This was a success and the pattern we invented were used henceforth for future client-server developments. (C#, .NET, Design Patterns, .NET Remoting, SQL Server)

_SiPass Integrated_

- Designed & implemented enhancement where visitors are allowed access to the building on particular dates (C++, MFC)
- Designed & implemented enhancement where users can scroll through a large database of cardholders with high performance & concurrency considerations. (C++, MFC, SQL Server UDFs)
- Designed & implemented mechanism for system-wide fetching of database credential information. (C++, COM, C++ .NET, C# .NET, C++ Cryptology, Wise for Windows Installer). The challenge overcame was designing it with extensibility in mind as it was used for all future projects data access.
- Designed & implemented mechanism for system-wide fetching of system sensitive database credential information. (C++, COM, C++ .NET, C# .NET, C++ Cryptology, Wise for Windows Installer)
- Integrated an external legacy access control system into SiPass by designing a migration tool and developing integration features into SiPass. (C++, COM, MFC, ODBC)

- Resolved issue with where user sessions were not identified properly and caused reporting of logged in users incorrectly, C++, COM
- Designed 20+ system bite sized enhancements requested by product line (C# .NET, COM+ MFC, .NET Message Queue, Crystal Reports, C++)
- Designed & implemented VC++7 module to detect which SQLServer versions are available on the domain & implementing into Wise for Windows Installer. (VC++7, Wise for Windows Installer)
- Detected & resolved C++ quality of code criteria to pass official Windows Vista Certification
- Implemented Wise for Windows Installer packaging for packaging new system components.
