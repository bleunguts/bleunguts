_ **Acheivements:** _

- Smart Card Hardware API development expertise
- Major innovation of our product which is the research &amp; development of a component to support smart card access control on personal office rooms cylinders. This is one of the two core selling points for our next release which the project manager assigned to me to take care of.
- Managed the suite of Digital Video Recording (DVR API) division of SiPass using C++ / COM interfacing with 3rd party developments. The video surveillance division involved programmable image capturing sequencing based on trigger-able events such as tripping of alarms. I had to developing enhancements using C++ COM to according to 3rd party vendor requests. (C++, ATL, STL, COM)

- Achieved appraisal for my succinct analysis skills delivering solutions to critical hard to solve live bugs which had a global impact.
- Successfully resolving 50+ show-stopping site problems mitigating delivering effective solutions with zero-risk. Each time I deliver a solution to a problem, I will identify if that mistake pattern exists elsewhere in the large-scale system effectively improving the quality of the system by delivering complete solutions. C++, C# .NET, COM, .NET Remoting, SQL Server, Wise, Memory Leaks

- With my drive to take ownership &amp; proven ability to deliver zero-risk solutions the project manager gave me more show-stopping site problems to solve, more enhancements to develop and more development areas to look after. After acknowledging my ability to manage time effectively with concurrent tasks &amp; my leadership qualities I was assigned team lead for 1-3 engineers so that I can transit out and concentrate on other critical design areas, I held responsibility of the outcome of the leading tasks.
- Resolved issue to do with OLE Server Busy error which was difficult to reproduce and for many years the anomaly was left unsolved. I isolated the issue to be a performance issue in the C++ RPC connectivity to the server. Resolved &amp; delivered with assistance from engineers that had experience with building this antique module. (C++, MFC)
- Designed &amp; implemented 20+ system enhancements which were smaller requirements requested by product line (C# .NET, COM+ MFC, .NET Message Queue, Crystal Reports, C++)

- Received notoriety in my attention to quality, was assigned responsible for quality assurance of requirements, design &amp; API manuals from other engineers.
- Strategised to develop &amp; employ automation tool to cut down costs for the problematic localization process. SiPass is translated into 12+ languages and €1.5 million is spent in localization alone. In recognition to my initiative &amp; sense of ownership I became the SME and supervised 2-3 engineers to develop automated solution using C#, scripting, C++ API interfacing and was highly appraised for cutting the cost of effort by 40+%. (C# .NET, Scripting, C++ RC-WinTrans API)
- Packaging and setup for our security product using Wise For Windows Installer
- Windows Vista compatibility technical optimization tickets in adherence to Microsoft Windows Vista standards

_ **Projects** __:_

- Lead the suite of Digital Video Recording division of SiPass using C++ / COM interfacing to 3rd parties for them to develop device drivers. This included developing enhancements using C++ COM to maintain the video stream between the hardware to SiPass. (C++, ATL, STL, COM)
- Designed &amp; developed an innovative key marketable component which was to implement a smart-card digital locking cylinder (HID&#39;s new R&amp;D invention) to create a wireless unlocking effect for end-users. This invention was designed I supervised 1 engineer with this project and the framework that I designed was to be used as a basis for future client-server developments. (C#, .NET, Design Patterns, .NET Remoting, SQL Server)

_SiPass Integrated_

- Designed &amp; implemented enhancement where visitors entered the building on particular dates (C++, MFC)
- Designed &amp; implemented enhancement where users can scroll through a large database of cardholders with high performance &amp; concurrency considerations. (C++, MFC, SQL Server UDFs)
- Designed &amp; implemented mechanism for system-wide fetching of database credential information. (C++, COM, C++ .NET, C# .NET, C++ Cryptology, Wise for Windows Installer). This was difficult because it will be used for all future projects that needed to access the database.
- Designed &amp; implemented mechanism for system-wide fetching of system sensitive database credential information. (C++, COM, C++ .NET, C# .NET, C++ Cryptology, Wise for Windows Installer)
- Integrated an external legacy access control system into SiPass by designing a migration tool and developing integration features into SiPass. (C++, COM, MFC, ODBC)
- Strategized an automation tool to cut down costs for the problematic localization process. SiPass is translated into 12+ languages and €1.5 million is spent in localization alone. I took initiative &amp; identified possible ways to increase productivity by using programming techniques. Assigned lead of 2 - 3 engineers to develop an automated solution using C#, scripting, C++ API interfacing (C# .NET, Scripting, C++ RC-WinTrans API). Received high appraisal for cutting the cost of effort by 40+%.
- Resolved issue with where user sessions were not identified properly and caused reporting of logged in users incorrectly, C++, COM
- Designed &amp; implemented 20+ system enhancements, C++, C# .NET, COM+ MFC, .NET Message Queue, Crystal Reports
- Designed &amp; implemented VC++7 module to detect which SQLServer versions are available on the domain &amp; implementing into Wise for Windows Installer. (VC++7, Wise for Windows Installer)
