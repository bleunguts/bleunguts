## Consultancy Experience
I have been in the industry for 20 years starting my career in start-ups & client-facing consultancies with the first eight years primarily in engineering software (door controllers, smart card, digital video recording surveillance, laser animation).  In 2008 I decided to move to UK to specialize in the domain of finance and have been working for investment banks and other financial institutions since.

I have acquired a diverse range of skills as a result and obtained depth of experience being actively involved in all phases of the software engineering lifecycle from inception and concept development through to construction, delivery and maintenance in both greenfield and maturing products.

Others include:
* core software development
* strong focus on business analysis and client-facing
* data analytics in splunk, dashboards, alerts design to capture business intelligence
* release management and coordination for large systems with many dependent sub-systems
* software end-user group training & presentation
* software sales and rapid prototyping
* high-end business scaling with distributed computing & computing grids
* working with cross-regional disparate teams in open source git PR platforms
* passion for end-user delivery and a permeating CAN DO attitude!
