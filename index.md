## Consultancy Experience
I have been in the industry for 20 years starting my career in start-ups with the first eight years primarily in engineering software (door controllers, smart card, elevator control).  In 2008 I decided to move to UK to specialize in the domain of finance and have been working for investment banks and other financial institutions since.

I have acquired a diverse range of skills as a result and obtained depth of experience being actively involved with software inception and concept development through to construction, delivery and post maintenance in greenfield and mature products.

These include:
* core software development
* strong focus on business analysis and client-facing
* data analytics in splunk, dashboards, alerts design to capture business intelligence
* release management and coordination for large systems with many dependent sub-systems
* software end-user group training & presentation
* software sales and rapid prototyping
* high-end business scaling with distributed computing & computing grids
* working with cross-regional disparate teams in open source git PR platforms
* passion for end-user delivery and a permeating CAN DO attitude!
