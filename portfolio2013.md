# Goldman Sachs

**Period** _:_ Feb &#39;08 – Nov &#39;08

**Length** _:_ 10 months

**Team Members:** 100+ strategists (5 teams in Core; Core QA, Core Install, Core Devs, Core Dbs, Quant Core Devs)

**Technologies:** Slang SecDb, Secdb inbuilt routines, quant routines, markup-language, dynamic table market data generation API, UI toolkit API

Low level diagnosis; VC++ 6 / 8, Java 1.4/1.6, Shell Scripting, CVS

Pricing models tests algorithms, quantitative routines, automated regression testing Infrastructure development, Slang technology tools, issue tracking tools, performance analysis tools development

**Environments:** Windows / RHEL4 Linux / Solaris

**Methodology:** Open Source, Code Approvals

**Description:** As a Core QA strategist we are expected to employ our leadership and intiative in identifying areas within the platform that require a QA focus and act at an electrifying pace to take said issues to resolution in such a fast-paced, complex, mission critical environment. SecDb distributes financial calculations units world-wide via its in-house compute grid and spans over equities, commodities, fixed income, IRP, new markets worldwide (NY, LDN, TKO, HK, BGL).

I worked on a regular basis with the world-class team of core devs core quant team, core install team, desk strategists focusing on the relentlessly tight bi-weekly SecDB releases.

This involved but not limited to capturing production issues from desks or working laterally through code inspection and investigating owners and impacted parties via rapidly programming Slang scripts.

Code inspection to identify design flaws and following-up with analysis of such impact, risk and potential future issues to improve the code base, and was frequently involved in code inspection to identify scalability and performance issues during times of volatile trading volumes.

Implementing improvements &amp; fine-tuning to ensure the timely delivery of the distributed regression rig results was a regular task, analysing of cyclomatic complexity of code to unveil potential issues in code, crafting tests for low level API code entry points such as popular programming paradigms that Slang exhibits.

Especially when sifting through contradictory implied assumptions from developer to developer, judgment &amp; team collaboration skills were imperative as global releases have a direct impact on the bottom line of Goldman Sachs.

**Achievements:**

- Major strength is in root-cause analysis of problem, proposing solutions to core developers. My breadth of knowledge in programming languages allowed me to be effective in identifying root cause (C++, Java, .NET).
- Balance of prioritization, liaising with skilled team members, making right judgments is a day-to-day aspect and plays a crucial part to the tight bi-weekly release schedule
- Contributed in improving core software release success rate from 5% to 100% (through diligent process optimization &amp; team command), thereafter received recognition by the Core team and thereafter I was assigned responsible for final signing off of SecDb releases. Commended by upper management for improving the quality of global releases!
- Working with team to bring resolution of many defects &amp; flaws in code that was inflicting down-time in real-time trading which consequently reduced system risk.
- Successfully drove QA process for VC6 to VC8 (.NET) upgrade for all applications/computers world-wide. In 2006 core has failed to release VC8 because of the complexity of a global upgrade from legacy VC6 to VC8. Leveraging from my prior experience in VC++ migrations to .NET and depth of understanding in memory / performance potential issues Goldman Sachs world-wide now utilizes VC8 for all its pricing/financial applications.
- Gained experience with dealing with financial pricing applications
- Created the Core QA presence in LDN – I started off as the sole member in LDN needing to determine, the requirements of the role, how to best utilize the differences in time-zones between LDN and NY. My contribution has allowed the LDN team to grow to two members as per date.
- Successfully conceptualized and implemented workflow enhancements into our existing QA Dashboard in Slang. Required accurate identification of workflow inefficiencies, implementing the enhancement and socializing in a timely matter.

**Projects:**

- RAMS (Regression Analysis) distributed over 1 billion calculation units running on the in-house grid to test regressions in releases or pricing sensitive changes
- Price regression analysis on all SecDb assets (equities, commodities, fixed income, IRP)
- Day-to-day PreProd differences analysis, analysis of test results including pricing model tests, pricing variation results, SecDb Core technology test results.

As it is infeasible to achieve test coverage for every aspect of system, pioneered an idea to use code inspection as to identify flaws in design and worked with core devs to resolve issues preventing production defect rate.

- Conceptualize, implement and refine test algorithms systems, based on inspection of application code, known defects and very limited functional requirements.
- Heavy design + development of workflow tools, Designing &amp; implementing tools for the QA infrastructure are a day-to-necessity at GS.
- Implemented speed / memory diagnosis tool that helps identify where in application discrepancy exists
- Tracking desks reports on software release issues via email or phone or reasoning from communications. As the nature of production defects are critical and often hold financial impact this was a crucial part of my role.
- Tracking issues that have been reported / found through testing / deduced from inspection to resolution. This requires performing root cause analysis, finding offending developers, working with desks / traders ensuring their applications are in safe position in a highly complex and critical financial environment.
- Root cause analysis of price discrepancies and working with developers to resolve the issue.
- Worked with feature switches to back out problematic features during release
- Worked with development of code quality cyclomatic analysis to provide statistics for slang/Secdb code
